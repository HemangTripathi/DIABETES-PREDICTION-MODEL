Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on a set of features such as glucose level, blood pressure, age, and body mass index (BMI). By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that can assist healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions.

Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which consists of the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset: Make sure you have the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset in the data/ folder.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: The data undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Training:

Run the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
The model is trained using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
Prediction:

To make predictions on new data, use:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input your_data.csv
Model Training
The model is trained using different classification algorithms. The main steps involved are:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature scaling and normalization
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Training various models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs in predicting diabetes.

Results
The final model achieves the following performance on the test data:

Accuracy: X%
Precision: X%
Recall: X%
F1-Score: X%
Note: Replace "X%" with the actual results from your model.
